Never A Day
Don't go standin' there
Blockin' my view
And spoilin' my night
You know why we're here
She's an old flame
I'm tryin' to lay
And if beauty sleep
Can really work
She must of just woken up
So rub your eyes
Never a day goes by
Without something
Stopping me hard in my tracks
I could be happy
And I'll never know it
Till never a day comes back
If words alone sound cheap
When I come around
You'll wanna be out
I want that window seat
If I'm goin' down
I wanna see out
And she's happy now
I'm goin' home
Another day
Another cruel reminder
Never a day goes by
Without something
Stopping me hard in my tracks
I could be happy
And I'll never know it
Till never a day comes back
Never a day goes by
Without something
Stopping me hard in my tracks
I could be happy
And I'll never know it
Till never a day comes back
Could be a song on the radio
Could be that feeling from long ago
Could be that accidental photo I find
When I'm looking for something else
But I found you
Never a day goes by
Without something
Stopping me hard in my tracks
I could be happy
And I'll never know it
Till never a day comes back
Never a day goes by
Without something
Stopping me hard in my tracks
I could be happy
And I'll never know it
