THE BODY
What would the body of Saint Francis be like? They say it was so delicate that it might have disappeared in the wind. It cast very little shadow: one's shadow is like pride in earthly possessions, like the shadow of a tree painting the grass, or the shadow of a woman who passes through a fountain and is instantly drenched. The humble one hardly casts a shadow.
He was small in stature. Just like a whitecap crossing the water, he traveled and sensed the presence that watched over his body.
His arms were light, so light. He did not feel them at his sides when they dropped. His head was like the small stamen inside a flower.
He walked gracefully: his legs passed lightly over the grass without trampling it, and his chest was narrow, although wide for love (love is the essence and not water which requires great vessels!) And his shoulders... they were narrowed by humility; they made one think of a very small cross, one smaller than the other.
