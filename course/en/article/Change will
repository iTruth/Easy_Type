CHANGE WILL
Seems an elderly gentleman had serious hearing problems for a number of years.
He went to the doctor and the doctor was able to have him fitted for a set of hearing aids that allowed the gentleman to hear 100%. The elderly gentleman went back in a month to the doctor and the doctor said, &quot;Your hearing is perfect. Your family must be really pleased you can hear again.&quot;
To which the gentleman said, &quot;Oh, I haven't told my family yet. I just sit around and listen to the conversations. I've changed my will five times!&quot;
